# Jshell

Jshell is available after Java 9.

```shell
jshell
jshell> int i = 10
jshell> System.out.println(i)
# To start up jshell with all printing in it. then you can use println, printf commands directly available.
jshell --startup DEFAULT PRINTING
jshell> println("Hello world")
jshell> /methods
jshell> /edit print
jshell> /?
jshell> /list -all // all commands in jshell
jshell> /list -start // what was it started with
```

vi hello.jsh
```java
System.out.println("Hello world");
/exit
```

```shell
jshell --startup hello.jsh
Hello world
```
